abstract: A long-standing question in the behavioral sciences is whether
  cognitive functions can be improved through dedicated training. It is
  uncontested that training programs can lead to near transfer, meaning
  increased performance on untrained tasks involving similar cognitive
  functions. However, whether training also leads to far transfer, meaning
  increased performance on loosely related untrained tasks or even activities of
  daily living, is still hotly debated. Here, we review the extant literature
  and, in particular, the most recent meta-analytic evidence and argue that the
  ongoing crisis in the field of cognitive-training research may benefit from
  taking a more mechanistic approach to studying the effectiveness of training.
  We propose that (a) adopting a more rigorous theoretical framework that builds
  on a process-based account of training and transfer, (b) considering the role
  of individual differences in the responsiveness to training, and (c) drawing
  on Bayesian models of development may help to solve controversial issues in
  the field and lead the way to designing and implementing more effective
  training protocols.
