abstract: Human decision-making is underpinned by distinct systems that differ
  in flexibility and associated cognitive cost. A widely accepted dichotomy
  distinguishes between a cheap but rigid model-free system and a flexible but
  costly model-based system. Typically, humans use a hybrid of both types of
  decision-making depending on environmental demands. However, childrenâ€™s use of
  a  model-based system during decision-making has not yet been shown. While
  prior developmental work has identified simple building blocks of model-based
  reasoning in young children  (1-4  years old),  there has been little evidence
  of this complex cognitive system influencing behavior before adolescence.Here,
  by using a modified task to make engagement in cognitively costly strategies
  more rewarding, we show that children aged 5 to 11-years (N = 85), including
  the youngest children, displayed multiple indicators of model-based decision
  making, and that the degree of its use increased throughout childhood. Unlike
  adults(N = 24), however, children did not display adaptive arbitration between
  model-free and model-based decision making.  Our results demonstrate that
  throughout childhood,  children are able to engage in highly sophisticated and
  costly decision-making strategies. However, the flexible arbitration between
  decision-making strategies might be a critically late-developing component in
  human development
