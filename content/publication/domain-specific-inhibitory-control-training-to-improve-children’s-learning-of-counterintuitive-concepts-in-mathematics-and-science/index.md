abstract: Evidence from cognitive neuroscience suggests that learning
  counterintuitive concepts in mathematics and science requires inhibitory
  control (IC). This prevents interference from misleading perceptual cues and
  naïve theories children have built from their experiences of the world. Here,
  we (1) investigate associations between IC, counterintuitive reasoning, and
  academic achievement and (2) evaluate a classroom-based computerised
  intervention, called Stop & Think, designed to embed IC training within the
  learning domain (i.e. mathematics and science content from the school
  curricula). Cross-sectional analyses of data from 627 children in Years 3 and
  5 (7- to 10-year-olds) demonstrated that IC, measured on a Stroop-like task,
  was associated with counterintuitive reasoning and mathematics and science
  achievement. A subsample (n = 456) participated either in Stop & Think as a
  whole-class activity (teacher-led, STT) or using individual computers
  (pupil-led, STP), or had teaching as usual (TAU). For Year 3 children (but not
  Year 5), Stop & Think led to better counterintuitive reasoning (i.e. near
  transfer) in STT (p < .001, ηp2 = .067) and STP (p < .01, ηp2 = .041) compared
  to TAU. Achievement data was not available for Year 3 STP or Year 5 STT. For
  Year 3, STT led to better science achievement (i.e. far transfer) compared to
  TAU (p < .05, ηp2 = .077). There was no transfer to the Stroop-like measure of
  IC. Overall, these findings support the idea that IC may contribute to
  counterintuitive reasoning and mathematics and science achievement. Further,
  we provide preliminary evidence of a domain-specific IC intervention with
  transferable benefits to academic achievement for Year 3 children.
